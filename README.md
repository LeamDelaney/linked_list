Open source linked list ADT. Written in C.
==========================================

I have written this ADT to show the readers of my software development blog
how you would go about building a linked list in the C programming language.

I have tried to keep this as robust as possible by utilizing void pointers to
allow you to create linked lists of any type, even your own custom types.

Since I provide no warranty for this code, by using it, you are agreeing to the
terms outlined in the DISCLAIMER.

Other than that. Have fun with this code, and be sure to let me know if
you use my ADT do something cool : Leam@xanthu.com
